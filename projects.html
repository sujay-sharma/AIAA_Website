            <h2>Design Build Fly</h2><br>
            <p>The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’
                    Design Build Fly is an annual international competition
                    sponsored by various aerospace companies and held in
                    Tucson, Arizona. The competition challenges students to
                    fabricate an RC aircraft to be evaluated through various
                    missions that are changed each year. Criteria of past missions
                    have included carrying simulated passengers and payloads and
                    executing difficult maneuvers in flight. Ninety-one teams from around the world competed in the 2018
                    competition, with the number of participants increasing every year.</p>

                <h2>Cansat</h2><br>
                <p>The 2018 CanSat competition objective was to design a
                        rocket payload with an aero-braking heat shield. After
                        being violently ejected from the rocket payload section,
                        the probe executes the following: <br>
                        • Aerodynamically orients itself <br>
                        • Deploys heat shield to control descent <br>
                        • Detaches heat shield as it deploys a parachute <br>
                        • Lands on ground while keeping delicate payload 
                        intact <br>
                        During descent, telemetry and atmospheric data is
                        transmitted real-time to ground station to be displayed
                        on a Heads-Up Display (HUD). The data being
                        displayed includes: Probe Orientation (x-y-z tilt), GPS
                        Location (Longitude + Latitude), Altitude (calculated from pressure), Pressure, Temperature, Humidity,
                        Battery Output Voltage.</p>

                <h2>RAD</h2><br>
                <p>The Research Aerospace Design program,
                        otherwise known as RAD, was started in August
                        2018 with the explicit goal to provide 24 selected
                        members with valuable team experience and to
                        introduce them to basic electronic design. RAD is a
                        two-semester long program, with the Fall semester
                        dedicated to weekly two-hour long workshops
                        where members are taught about designing and
                        implementing electronics in aircraft.
                        The workshops themselves are split between a
                        lecture section and a lab section where members
                        directly apply what they learned through building
                        small scale circuits to power LEDs to more robust designs that involve using a microcontroller and a
                        shield for operating brushless motors.</p>
