                <p><strong>Major:</strong> Mechanical Engineering <br>
                   <strong>Class:</strong> Senior <br><br>     
                        
                    <strong>About Me:</strong> I'm a DFW native. I play a little bit of guitar and spend a lot of my free time on Youtube. 
                    Currently working at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center through the Pathways Co-op Program since January 2018. 
                    I really like finding new music. I really don't like crunchy pretzels.
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>Interest in Aerospace:</strong> I have wanted to work for NASA since middle school. I didn't know that 
                    astronautics  was really my passion until high school, however, when I started really getting into a lot of sci-fi 
                    and began imagining the way that space technology can change what it means to be human. Now that I have some 
                    exposure to the industry, I think my main interest is in launch vehicle systems and low earth orbit mobility. 
                    Later in my career, I would like to be involved in deep space technology, however. Possibly in advanced propulsion 
                    systems research.  
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Dream Job:</strong> My dream job is to be the CEO of my own space company. I won't say exactly what my idea is, 
                    in case someone steals it, but it doesn't have to do with launch vehicles. In order to get there though, I hope that 
                    I am able to gain a lot of experience working with NASA for several years and eventually go into private industry. 
                    I want to be able to look at a piece of technology that has changed spaceflight and say, "I had a hand in 
                    designing/developing that."</p>

                    <strong>Class:</strong> Senior <br><br>
                    <strong>About Me:</strong> I am a senior graduating in May, majoring in EE and CE, with a minor in Physics. 
                    I participate in a few clubs, but AIAA is my favorite academic one, because we get to actually build things! 
                    I'm looking forward to building a large rocket with the IREC team this year, as the goal is to shoot it literally 
                    miles into the air!
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>Interest in Aerospace:</strong> The space part! I love all those sci-fi shows like Stargate and Star Trek, 
                    and I always enjoyed building model rockets when I was little. I am hoping for some evidence of the underlying cause 
                    of the Fermi Paradox sometime in my lifetime too! (Where are all the aliens?!?!)
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Dream Job:</strong> I have no idea yet. Which is really concerning, because I graduate in less than a year!</p>

                    <strong>About Me:</strong> Previous production support intern at Raytheon and semiconductor packaging intern at 
                    Texas Instruments, Dolly enjoys taking technical communication to the next level with graphic design and interpersonal 
                    skills. At UTD, she is a fast-tracking student, peer advisor, freshman mentor,  graphic designer, and an officer in 
                    various organizations. Dolly enjoys taking up various new projects, ranging from learning to code in VBA to learning
                     to play new instruments. 
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>Interest in Aerospace:</strong> Working as a production support intern on Raytheon's MTS (Multi-spectral 
                    Targeting Systems) helped Dolly understand her interest in multi-optical systems. For her, the need for thermal 
                    and mechanical robustness in aviation equipment to better protect our country drives her to understand more in 
                    astronautics and aeronautics.
